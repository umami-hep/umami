## Resampling
The resampling step is the most crucial task of the preprocessing. Using the samples from the preparation step, the resampling stitches together the used processes and, based on the resampling method used, resamples all flavours used to one target flavour. Due to differences in the number of jets in different $p_T$ and $\eta$ regions, the tagging of the jets is not independent of those regions. To ensure a kinematic independent tagging of the jets, the resampling methods sample the different flavours so that in the given $p_T$ and $\eta$ bins, the same amount of jets per flavour are present. The technique how this is done are specific to the method. In their respective section, this will be explained more in detail. This 2D resampling is illustrated with the following plot from [Manuel Guth's PhD Defense Talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/981227/#1-search-for-tthbb-production):


![Example for 2D resampling in pT and eta](../assets/resampling.png)

For the `count` (or down-sampling), `PDF` (a combination fo up- and down-sampling) and `importance_no_replace` (similar to `PDF` but no reusing of the jets) methods, we first fill the target flavour in your 2D bins. After that, for each bin, the same amount of jets from other flavours, which fit in the 2D bin, are added. This up- and down-sampling is illustrated in the following plot from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rafjaa/resampling-strategies-for-imbalanced-datasets/notebook):

The `Weighting Sampling` is not a real resampling, in the same sense as the others. To achieve the kinematic independent training sample, weights are calculated for all jets according to their $p_T$ and $\eta$ values. This is similar to a 2D reweighting.

### General Config File Options
The resampling part of the config file starts with the `sampling:` dict.

```yaml
§§§examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing.yaml:99:105§§§
```

In `sampling`, we can define now the method which is used in the preprocessing for resampling. `method` defines the method which is used. Currently available are `count`, `pdf`, `importance_no_replace` and `weighting`. The details of the different sampling methods are explained at their respective sections. The here shown config is for the `count` method.

An important part are the `class_labels` which are defined here. You can define which flavours are used in the preprocessing. The name of the available flavours can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/umami/configs/global_config.yaml). Add the names of those to the list to add them to the preprocessing. **PLEASE KEEP THE ORDERING CONSTANT! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**. This list must be the same as the one in the train config!

For an explanation of the resampling function specific `options`, have a look in the section of the resampling method you want to use. The general `options` are explained in the following:

```yaml
§§§examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing.yaml:141:177§§§
```

| Setting | Type | Explanation |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `fractions` | `dict` | Gives the fractions of $t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$ in the final training sample. These values need to add up to 1! |
| `n_jets`  | `int` |  Number of target jets to be taken. For PDF sampling, this is the number of jets per class in the final training sample, while for other methods it is the total number of jets after resampling. For the `pdf` method, setting this value to `-1` maximises the number of jets in the training sample. |
| `save_tracks` | `bool` | Define if tracks are processed or not. These are not needed to train DL1r/DL1d |
| `tracks_names` | `list` of `str` | Name of the tracks (in the .h5 files coming from the dumper) which are processed. Multiple tracks datasets can be preprocessed simultaneously when two `str` are given in the list. |
| `save_track_labels` | `bool` | If this value is `True`, the track variables in `track_truth_variables` will be processed as labels without scaling. The will be saved in an extra group in the final training file. The name will be `Y_<track_name>_train`. `<track_name>` is here the name of the track collection. |
| `track_truth_variables` | `str` or `list` | Track variables that will be handled as truth labels. Multiple can be given in a `list` of `str` or just one in a single string. |
| `intermediate_index_file` | `str` | For the resampling, the indicies of the jets to use are saved in an intermediate indicies `.h5` file. You can define a name and path in the [Preprocessing-parameters.yaml](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/examples/preprocessing/Preprocessing-parameters.yaml). |
| `n_jets_scaling` | `int` | Number of jets which are used to calculate scaling and shifting values. If `null` is given, all jets in file are used. |
| `n_jets_to_plot` | `int` | Number of jets which are used for plotting the variables of the jets/tracks after each preprocessing step (resampling, scaling, shuffling/writing). If `null` is given, the plotting is skipped. |


**Note**: `n_jets` are the number of jets you want to have in your final training file for the `count` and `weighting` method. For the `pdf` method, this is the number of jets per flavour in the training file!

### Count Sampling

Standard undersampling approach. Undersamples all flavours to the statistically lowest flavour used.

```yaml
§§§examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing.yaml:108:138§§§
```

| Setting | Type | Explanation |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `sampling_variables` | `list` |  Needs exactly 2 variables. Sampling variables which are used for resampling. The example shows this for the `pt_btagJes` and `absEta_btagJes` variables. In case of the `count` method, you define a nested list (one sublist for each category ($t\bar{t}$ or $Z'$)) with the first and last bin edge and the number of bins to use. |
| `custom_n_jets_initial` | `dict` | Used jets per sample to ensure a smooth hybrid sample of $t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$, we need to define some empirically derived values for the $t\bar{t}$ samples. |
| `samples` | `dict` | You need to define them for `ttbar` and `zprime`. The samples defined in here are the ones we prepared in the step above. To ensure a smooth hybrid sample of $t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$, we need to define some empirically derived values for the $t\bar{t}$ samples in `custom_n_jets_initial`. |

### Importance Sampling With Replacement (PDF Sampling)

The PDF sampling method is based on the principles of importance sampling. If your sample's statistics are small and/or your lowest distribution is other than the target distribution (in case of b-tagging, this is the b-jet distribution), you can force the b-jet distribution shape on the other jet flavour distributions. This will ensure all the distributions have the target distribution shape and the same fractions for the two given resampling variables. To enforce the same shape and number of jets per $p_T$ and $\eta$ bin, the statistically higher flavours are undersampled and the statistically lower flavours are upsampled to the target flavour. An example for the reprocessing config file which uses the pdf sampling can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing-taus.yaml). In this case, four different flavours are used.

The options for the pdf method seems quite similar to the ones from the `count` method. But there are some important differences!
First are the bins for the two resampling variables. You need to define a nested list with the regions for both sample categories ($t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$). Even if they are the same!

```yaml
  options:
    sampling_variables:
      - pt_btagJes:
          # bins take either a list containing the np.linspace arguments
          # or a list of them
          # For PDF sampling: must be the np.linspace arguments.
          #   - list of of list, one list for each category (in samples)
          #   - define the region of each category.
          bins: [[0, 25e4, 100], [25e4, 6e6, 100]]

      - absEta_btagJes:
          bins: [[0, 2.5, 10], [0, 2.5, 10]]

    # Decide, which of the in preparation defined samples are used in the resampling.
    samples:
      ttbar:
        - training_ttbar_bjets
        - training_ttbar_cjets
        - training_ttbar_ujets
      zprime:
        - training_zprime_bjets
        - training_zprime_cjets
        - training_zprime_ujets

    custom_n_jets_initial: # Leave empty for pdf method

    # For PDF sampling, this is the maximum upsampling rate (important to limit tau upsampling)
    # File are referred by their key (as in custom_n_jets_initial)
    max_upsampling_ratio:
      training_ttbar_cjets: 5
      training_zprime_cjets: 5

    # For PDF sampling, this scales the total number of training jets in the training dataset by
    # given factor, i.e. a factor of 1 has no effect
    sampling_fraction:
      training_ttbar_cjets: 1
```

| Setting | Type | Explanation |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `sampling_variables` | `list` |  Needs exactly 2 variables. Sampling variables which are used for resampling. The example shows this for the `pt_btagJes` and `absEta_btagJes` variables. In case of the `pdf` method, you define a nested list (one sublist for each category ($t\bar{t}$ or $Z'$)) with the first and last bin edge and the number of bins to use (np.linespace arguments). |
| `custom_n_jets_initial` | `None` | These values are used only in the `count` and `weighting` method. |
| `samples` | `dict` | You need to define them for `ttbar` and `zprime`. The samples defined in here are the ones we prepared in the step above. To ensure a smooth hybrid sample of $t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$, we need to define some empirically derived values for the $t\bar{t}$ samples in `custom_n_jets_initial`. |
| `max_upsampling_ratio` | `dict` | Here you can define for the different samples, which are defined in the `samples` section, a maximal ratio of upsampling. If there are not enough cjets and the `max_upsampling_ratio` is reached, the form of the distribution is applied but not the number. So there can be different numbers of jets per bin per class, but the shape of distributions will still be the same (if you normalise them). |
|`sampling_fraction` | `dict` | Here you can define for the different samples, which are defined in the `samples` section, a factor to scale the number of jets for this sample in the final training dataset compared to the number of jets defined in `n_jets`. This can be useful if subclasses of u-, c- and/or b-jets are used for training but the overall ratio for u-,c- and b-jet should still be 1:1:1|

### Importance Sampling Without Replacement

Method based on the principles of importance sampling. This method is similar to the count method but with the added flexibility of being able to take a target distribution which all the other distributions should fall under. The implementation also ensuring same fractions per flavor. The difference between this method and the PDF sampling method, is that examples/events are not repeated. You can force the b-jet distribution shape on the other jet flavour distributions by specifying the target distribution to be the b-jets. This will ensure all the distributions have the b-jets shape and same fractions for the two given resampling variables $p_T$ and $\eta$ . To enforce the same shape and number of jets per $p_T$ and $\eta$ bin, first the sampling probabilityies are calculated using `target / distribution_i`, where `distribution_i` is for each flavour, then the distributions are scaled up/down using the maximum sampling probability. The statistically higher flavours are undersampled and the statistically lower flavours are first scaled then downsampled to the target flavour.

The options for the this method are similar to the ones from the `count` method.

```yaml
sampling:
  # Downsampling method that gives same fractions and shape
  # distributions given a target distribution, here the b-jets
  method: importance_no_replace

  options:
    # Specify the target distribution
    target_distribution: bjets
    # jet variables used
    sampling_variables:
      - pt_btagJes:
          # bins take either a list containing the np.linspace arguments
          # or a list of them
          bins: bins: [0, 15e5, 250]

      - absEta_btagJes:
          bins: [0, 2.5, 9]

    # Decide, which of the in preparation defined samples are used in the resampling.
    samples:
      ttbar:
        - training_ttbar_bjets
        - training_ttbar_cjets
        - training_ttbar_ujets
      zprime:
        - training_zprime_bjets
        - training_zprime_cjets
        - training_zprime_ujets

    # Set to -1 or don't include this to use all the available jets
    n_jets: -1
```

| Setting | Type | Explanation |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `sampling_variables` | `list` |  Needs exactly 2 variables. Sampling variables which are used for resampling. The example shows this for the `pt_btagJes` and `absEta_btagJes` variables. In case of the `pdf` method, you define a nested list (one sublist for each category ($t\bar{t}$ or $Z'$)) with the first and last bin edge and the number of bins to use (np.linespace arguments). |
| `samples` | `dict` | Needs all the different samples for `ttbar` and `zprime`. The samples defined in here are the ones we prepared in the step above.|
| `target_distribution` | `str` | Target distribution to be used for computing the sampling probabilities relative to. This ensures all the final resampled distributions have the same shape and fraction as the target distribution. Default is the `bjets`. |

### Weighting Sampling

Alternatively you can calculate weights between the flavor of bins in the 2d(pt,eta) histogram and write out all jets. These weights can be forwarded to the training to weigh the loss function of the training. If you want to use them don't forget to set `bool_attach_sample_weights` to `True`.

```yaml
  options:
    sampling_variables:
      - pt_btagJes:
          # bins take either a list containing the np.linspace arguments
          # or a list of them
          # For PDF sampling: must be the np.linspace arguments.
          #   - list of list, one list for each category (in samples)
          #   - define the region of each category.
          bins: [[0, 600000, 351], [650000, 6000000, 84]]

      - absEta_btagJes:
          # For PDF sampling: same structure as in pt_btagJes.
          bins: [0, 2.5, 10]

    # Decide, which of the in preparation defined samples are used in the resampling.
    samples:
      ttbar:
        - training_ttbar_bjets
        - training_ttbar_cjets
        - training_ttbar_ujets
      zprime:
        - training_zprime_bjets
        - training_zprime_cjets
        - training_zprime_ujets

    # for method: weighting
    # relative to which distribution the weights should be calculated
    weighting_target_flavour: 'bjets'

    # If you want to attach weights to the final files
    bool_attach_sample_weights: False
```

| Setting | Type | Explanation |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `weighting_target_flavour` | `str` | To which distribution the weights are relatively calculated to. |
| `bool_attach_sample_weights` | `bool` | Decide, if you want to attach these weights in the final training config. For all other resampling methods, this should be `False`. |

### Running the Resampling
The resampling can be started after the preparation step is finished with the command:

```bash
preprocessing.py --config <path to config file> --resampling
```

??? info "Parallel processing for the PDF method"

    If you want to also use the tracks of the jets, you need to set the option `save_tracks` in the preprocessing config to `True`. If the tracks have a different name than `"tracks"` in the .h5 files coming from the dumper, you can also set change `tracks_names` to your needs. Track information are not needed for the DL1r but for DIPS and Umami.
    If you are using the `pdf` resampling method, you can further split this up into sub-components. First you need to start with working on the target distribution:

    ```bash
    preprocessing.py --config <path to config file> --resampling --flavour target
    ```

    This will process the target distribution for both categories, $t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$. After this is finished, you can run in parallel the following step:

    ```bash
    preprocessing.py --config <path to config file> --resampling --flavour $0
    ```

    where the `$0` stands for an index in `samples/ttbar`. If we take the example from the PDF Sampling section, this contains the samples of the bjets, cjets and ujets. 0 is therefore the bjets, 1 is the cjets and 2 is the ujets. Note: This will process the bjets for both categories, $t\bar{t}$ and $Z'$, although we need to look in `samples/ttbar`. Only the flavour is important here.

    After all these subjobs are finished, you can continue with the plotting (this step plots the distributions of the resampled variables before the actual resampling) and the combination of the flavours into our final resampled file. For that you need to run

    ```bash
    preprocessing.py --config <path to config file> --resampling --flavour plotting
    ```

    and

    ```bash
    preprocessing.py --config <path to config file> --resampling --flavour combining
    ```

    where the plotting step can also be skipped if you want to.

**Note**: The steps defined in here are only performed on the training samples! You do not need to resample the validation/test samples execept you want to also produce the hybrid validation and test samples. For instructions to do that, please look at [ADD ME]().

#### Hybrid validation and testing resampling

To create hybrid `ttbar` and `zprime` validation samples that are also resampled like the training samples see the following file for a full example: [`examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing-hybrid-validation.yaml`](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing-hybrid-validation.yaml).

???+ warning "Do not use for creating training samples"

    This preprocessing config example should only be used to create the hybrid validation or testing samples. This example should be adapted to reflect your training sample resampling method.

Then you can just do:

```bash
# prepare, apply cuts and split all flavours
preprocessing.py --config examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing-hybrid-validation.yaml --prepare
# resample and recombine
preprocessing.py --config examples/preprocessing/PFlow-Preprocessing-hybrid-validation.yaml --resampling
```
