# Plotting the evaluation results
The evaluation results can be plotted using different functions. There is the [plotting_umami.py](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/umami/umami/plotting_umami.py), [plotting_epoch_performance](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/umami/umami/plotting_epoch_performance.py) and the [plot_input_variables.py](). Each plotting script is explained in its dedicated section.

## plotting_umami.py
The plotting_umami.py is used to plot the results of the evaluation script. Different plots can be produced with it which are fully customizable. All plots that are defined in the `plotting_umami_config_X.yaml`. The `X` defines the tagger here but its just a name. All config files are usable with the [plotting_umami.py](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/umami/umami/plotting_umami.py) script.

### Yaml Config File
**Important: The indentation in this .yaml is important due to the way the files are read by the script.**   
A fully written one can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/umami/examples/plotting_umami_config_dips.yaml).   
The config file starts with the `Eval_parameters`. Here the `Path_to_models_dir` is set, where the models are saved. Also the `model_name` and the `epoch` which is to be plotted is set. A boolean parameter can be set here to indicate whether to plot with taus included (requires to have train and preprocessed with taus). For example, this can look like this:

```yaml
Eval_parameters:
  Path_to_models_dir: /work/ws/nemo/fr_af1100-Training-Simulations-0/b-Tagging/packages/umami/umami
  model_name: dips_Loose_lr_0.001_bs_15000_epoch_200_nTrainJets_Full
  epoch: 59
  bool_use_taus: False
```

In the different available plots, there are options that are available in mostly all of them. So they will be explained next. For specific options, look at the comment in the section of the plot.   

`Name_of_the_plot`: All plots start with no indentation and the name of plot. This will be the output name of the plot file and has no impact on the plot itself.   

`type`: This option specifies the plot function that is used.   

`data_set_name`: Decides which evaluated dataset (or file) is used. Options are `ttbar` for the `test_file`, `zpext` for the `add_test_file`, `ttbar_comparison` for the `comparison_file` and `zpext_comparison` for the `add_comparison_file`.   

`models_to_plot`: In the comparison plots, the models which are to be plotted needs to be defined in here. You can add as many models as you want. For example this can be used to plot the results of the different taggers in one plot.   

`plot_settings`: In this section, all optional plotting settings are defined. They don't need to be defined but you can. For the specific available options in each function, look in the corresponding section.

### Executing the Script
The script can be executed by using the following command:

```bash
plotting_umami.py -c ${EXAMPLES}/plotting_umami_config_dips.yaml -o dips_eval_plots
```

The `-o` option defines the name of the output directory. It will be added to the model folder where also the results are saved.
