## Start Training your Model

After all files are preprocessed, we can start with the training. In the following sections, the global settings and the neural network settings are explained more in detail. If you want to train completely fresh, you can just adapt one of the example config files. The creation of the model folder is taken care of when we start the actual training!

### Global Settings

The global settings are the base settings needed for every training. Here we define general things like the model name and which preprocessing config file was used to produce the train dataset.

```yaml
§§§examples/training/Dips-PFlow-Training-config.yaml:1:58§§§
```

| Options | Data Type | Necessary, Optional | Explanation |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| `model_name` | `str` | Necessary | Name of the model you want to train. This will be the name of the folder, where all results etc. will be saved in. This folder will automatically be created if not existing. |
| `preprocess_config` | `str` | Necessary | Path to the preprocessing config you used to produce the train datasets. When you start the training and the folder for the model is created, this file is copied to the `metadata/` folder inside the model folder. Also, the path here in the train config will be changed to the new path of the preprocessing config inside the `metadata/` folder. |
| `model_file` | `str` | Optional | If you already have a model and want to use the weights of this model as start point (maybe you have a R21 trained model and now you want to use the weights of that model as initial weights for your R22 training), you can give the path to this model here. This model will be loaded and used instead of init a new one. If you don't set `load_optimiser` in `nn_structure`, the optimiser state will be resetted. If you just want to continue a specific training, use `continue_training` and leave this option empty. |
| `train_file` | `str` | Necessary | Path to the training sample. This is given by the `preprocessing` step of Umami. If you want to use the `TFRecords` format to train, this must be the path to the folder where the `TFRecords` files are saved. |
| `continue_training` | `bool` | Optional | If your training died due to time constrains of jobs and you just want to continue the training from the latest point on, set this value to `True` and restart the training. |
| `exclude` | `list` | Necessary | List of jet variables that are excluded from training. Only compatible with DL1* training!. To include all, just set this option to `null`. If you don't train DL1* also set this just to `null`. |
|`tracks_name`| `str` | Necessary | Name of the tracks data-set to use for training and evaluation, default is "tracks". If you are training DL1*, just remove this option. <br /> ***This option is necessary when using tracks, but, when working with old preprocessed files (before January 2022, Tag 05 or older) this option has to be removed form the config file to ensure compatibility*** |

Two uncovered options are the `validation_files` and the `test_files`. Here we simply define the files which are later used for the validation/evaluation step. It is possible to define multiple validation files using the dict structure shown in the example. Focusing on the `validation_files` first, each entry needs a unique name. This name is the internal identifier for this specific file. The options defined in this entry are explained here:

| Options | Data Type | Necessary, Optional | Explanation |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| `path` | `str` | Necessary | Path to the validation/test file which is to be used. Using wildcards is possible. |
| `label` | `str` | Necessary | Label which is used for this file when plotting the validation plots. |
| `variable_cuts` | `dict` | Optional | `dict` of cuts which are applied when loading the different test files. Only jet variables can be cut on. These are in this example defined as templates for the different samples types. |

Focusing now on the `test_files`, the options are the same but no `label` is needed, because the plotting of the evaluation results is an extra step covered [here](../plotting/plotting_umami.md).

Both options can also be added after the training is finished. For the training itself, you can leave this options blank.

### Network Settings

The next section in the train config is the `nn_structure`. Here we define all the information needed for building the model, like which tagger we want to use and also the number of hidden layer and nodes per hidden layer. The general options are shown next while the tagger dependant options are shown in their respective subsections.

In "min" mode, the learning rate will be reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in "max" mode it will be reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in "auto" mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity. Default: "auto" |

### Running the Training

After the global- and network settings are prepared, you can start training your model. To start the training, switch to the `umami/umami` folder and run the following command:

```bash
train.py -c <path to train config file> --prepare
```

This command will not directly start the training, but will prepare the model folder with all needed configs/scale dicts etc. Before starting the real training, you should check all config files again. The new folder will have the name given in `model_name`. In there is a folder called `metadata` in which all configs/scale dicts etc. were copied. Also, all paths in the config are adapted to the metadata folder, like the path to the preprocessing config etc.
After you checked everything, you can run the real training via the command:

```bash
train.py -c <path to train config file>
```

This will start the real training. Other command line arguments available for `train.py` are `-o` which will overwrite the configs/dicts in metadata if you run the training.

**Note** When training, the callback methods of the different taggers validate the training on the fly which can lead to memory issues. To deactivate the on the fly validation, what we recommend, just set the `n_jets` option in the `validation_settings` section of the train config to `0`.
