???+ question "What is the `exclude` option and how does it work?"



    The `exclude` option is an option reserved for DL1* models. With that, certain jet variables which are present in the training sample, can be excluded from the training. The option itself is a list of all variables you want to exclude. **Note** Track variables can not be excluded!
