# Plotting in Umami

The umami framework provides extensive plotting options for variable and performance plots.
It serves as a high-level wrapper to the [Plotting UMami Api (`puma`)](https://github.com/umami-hep/puma/).

The python API `puma` can also be used stand-alone. In the following section you can find more details about the plotting using Umami to steer the output via configuration files.
