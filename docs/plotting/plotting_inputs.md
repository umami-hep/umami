# Plotting Input Variables
The input variables for different files can also be plotted using the `plot_input_variables.py` script. Its also steered by a yaml file. An example for such a file can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/examples/plotting_input_vars.yaml). The structure is close to the one from `plotting_umami` but still a little bit different.
To start the plotting of the input variables, you need to run the following command

```bash
plot_input_vars.py -c <path/to/config> --tracks
```

or

```bash
plot_input_vars.py -c <path/to/config> --jets
```

which will plot either all plots defined using jet- or track variables. You can also give the `-f` or `--format` option where you can decide on a format for the plots. The default is `pdf`.

### Yaml File
In the following, the possible configration parameters are listed with a brief description. 

#### Variable dict and number of jets
Here you can define the number of jets that are used and also the variable dict, where all the variables that are available are saved.

    ```yaml

    ```

#### Number of Tracks per Jet
The number of tracks per jet can be plotted for all different files. This can be given like this:

#### Input Variables Jets
To plot the jet input variables, the following options are used.

??? example "Click to see corresponding code in the [example config file](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/examples/plotting_input_vars.yaml)"
    ```yaml
    §§§examples/plotting_input_vars.yaml:16:93§§§
    ```

| Options | Data Type | Necessary/Optional | Explanation |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| `input_vars_trks_ttbar_loose_ptfrac` | `str` | Necessary | Name of the plots. This does not effect anything for the plots itself. |
| `variables` | `str` | Necessary | Must be set to "jets" for this function. Decides, which functions for plotting are used. |
| `folder_to_save` | `str` | Necessary | Path where the plots should be saved. This is a relative path. Add a folder name as path. |
| `Datasets_to_plot` | None | Necessary | Here the category starts of which plots shall be plotted. |

| `label` | `str` | Necessary | Plot label for the plot legend. |

| `binning` | None | Necessary | Here starts the binning for each variable. If you give a `int`, there will be so much equal distant bins. You can also give a three element `list` which will be used in the `numpy.arange` function. The first element is start, second is stop and third is the step width. The so arranged numbers are bin edges not bins! If `None` is given, the standard value is `100`. Variables that are not in here are not plotted! |
| `plot_settings` | `dict` | Necessary | Here starts the plot settings. See possible parameters in the section below. |

#### Plot settings
The `plot_settings` section is similar for all three cases described above. 
In order to define some settings you want to apply to all plots, use yaml anchors
as shown here:

??? example "Click to see corresponding code in the [example config file](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-flavor-tagging-tools/algorithms/umami/-/blob/master/examples/plotting_input_vars.yaml)"
    ```yaml
    §§§examples/plotting_input_vars.yaml:1:7§§§
    ```

Most of the plot settings are valid for all types of input variable plots 
(i.e. jet variables, track variables and the n_tracks plot).
If a parameter is only valid for a certain type of plot, this is listed below.


## Plot settings
You have to specify some parameters for the plots themselves, like for example the
`binning` of all the variables. *Note that the binning also indicates if a variable is 
plotted or not.*

You can use the following parameters. Note that some parameters are not supported for all types of plots.

| Options | Plot Type | Data Type | Necessary/Optional | Explanation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| `binning` | All | `int`, `list` or empty | Necessary | Here starts the binning for each variable. If you give a `int`, there will be that many equal-width bins. You can also give a three element `list` which will be used in the `numpy.arange` function. The first element is start, second is stop and third is number of bins. The so arranged numbers are bin edges not bins! If no value is given, the standard value is `100`. If a variable is not defined here, its not plotted. |
| `sorting_variable` | Track variables | `str` | Optional | Variable Name to sort after. |
| `n_leading` | Track variables | `list` | Optional | `list` of the x leading tracks. If `None`, all tracks will be plotted. If `0` the leading tracks sorted after `sorting variable` will be plotted. You can add like `None`, `0` and `1` for example and it will plot all 3 of them, each in their own folders with according labeling. This must be a `list`! Even if there is only one option given. |
| `track_origins` | Track variables and n_tracks plot | `list` | Optional | `list` that gives the desired track origins when plotting. |

All remaining plot settings are parameters which are handed to `puma` (Plotting
UMami API) more specifically the `HistogramPlot` class.
Therefore, all parameters supported by the `HistogramPlot` class can be specified there.
