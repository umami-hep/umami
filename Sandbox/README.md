# First pass at implementing umami

**Goal:** For the FTAG workshop, we combined the DL1 and DIPS
preprocessing steps into a combined dataset, so we're interested
now to see if we can take this combined dataset and get some a
performance plot for when we train the taggers together, even if
it's on a much smaller dataset than we currently use, just to 
start building our intuition.
